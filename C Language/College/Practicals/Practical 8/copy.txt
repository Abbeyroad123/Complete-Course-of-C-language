One night four college students were out partying late night and didn’t study for the test
which was scheduled for the next day. In the morning, they thought of a plan. They
made themselves look dirty with grease and dirt. Then they went to the Dean and said
they had gone out to a wedding last night and on their way back the tire of their car
burst and they had to push the car all the way back. So they were in no condition to take
the test.
The Dean thought for a minute and said they can have the re-test after 3 days. They
thanked him and said they will be ready by that time. On the third day, they appeared
before the Dean. The Dean said that as this was a Special Condition Test, all four were
required to sit in separate classrooms for the test. They all agreed as they had prepared
well in the last 3 days. The Test consisted of only 2 questions with the total of 100
Points:
1) Your Name? __________ (1 Points)
2) Which tire burst? __________ (99 Points)
Options – (a) Front Left (b) Front Right (c) Back Left (d) Back Right
