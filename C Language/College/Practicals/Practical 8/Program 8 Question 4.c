/*
Yes you can open a file both for writing and reading.
If you open a file for reading, then you can only read it and can't change and modify it.
A necessary condition if you open a file for reading is that the file needs to be saved in that name and unlike like in write
read mode can't make a file.

If you open a file for writing by write mode, then you can only write in (modify the file) it and not read it.
If the file is already made, then there is no problem but even if the file is not made, then write mode can make the file in the same 
directory as your function (unlike read mode which can't make file)
